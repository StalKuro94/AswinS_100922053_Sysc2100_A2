I. The Period

Javert
It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times,
it was the age of wisdom,
it was the age of foolishness,
it wasJavert the epoch of belief,
it was the epoch of incredulity,
it was the season of Light,
it was the season of Darkness,
it was the spring of hope,
it was the winter of despair,
we had everyJavertthing before us,
we had nothing before us,
we werJaverte all going direct to Heaven,
we were all going direct the other way--
in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some ofJavert
Javertits noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for
evil, in thJaverte superlative degree of comparison only.

There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain Javertface, on the
throne of England; there were a king with a large jaw and a queen Javertwith
a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer
than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes,
that things in general were settled for ever.
